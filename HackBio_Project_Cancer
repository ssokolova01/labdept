# TASK:
#Anatomy and Physiology [Cancer]
# •	Look at this dataset
# •	How do you distinguish benign from malignant datasets?
# •	Using PCA and K-Mean clustering, classify and cluster the patients.
# •	Do you think there are other subclasses within the dataset?

# Question 1. Dataset Overview

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load dataset
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Machine-Learning-in-Biotechnology-and-Life-Sciences/refs/heads/main/datasets/dataset_wisc_sd.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# BASIC INFO
print("Dataset Overview:")
print(df.info())

# FIRST FEW ROWS
print("\n First 5 Rows:")
print(df.head())

# CHECK FOR MISSING VALUES
print("\n Missing Values Per Column:")
print(df.isnull().sum())

# CHECK UNIQUE VALUES IN TARGET
print ("\n Target variable distribution (Diagnosis):")
print(df['diagnosis'].value_counts())

#VISUALISATION
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.countplot(data=df, x='Diagnosis', palette='Set2')
plt.title('Count of Diagnosis Classes (Benign vs Malignant)')
plt.show()

# Main results: 
# 1) The dataset consists of 32 columns and 569 rows. 
# 2) Missing values were found in the columns: area_mean (2), radius_se (3), fractal_dimension_se (1), smoothness_worst (1).
# 3) Diagnosis distribution is: 212 cases for Malignant and 357 cases for Benign. (graph image: https://github.com/ssokolova01/labdept/issues/1#issue-3010338651)


# Question 2. Distinguish benign and malignant dataset.

# Benign and malignant characteristics correspond to the "diagnosis" column data. 
# Supervised classification is used including two methods applied to train the model: logistic regression and Random Forest.
# The diagnosis is the target by which malignant and benign datasets are distinguished.
# Other columns' data, except "id" and "diagnosis", are the features. There are 30 features.
# The comparison of the effectiveness of both methods is done.
